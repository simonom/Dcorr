The Matlab code for the analytical method to solve diffusion is found in   analyt_eq31_simple5.m, while the code for the numerical method is contained in pde_ideal4.m.  The latter can be called by eq_time_valuation_pde2.m.  The code for MOSAIC has not been made publicly available, however the results relevent to this paper are contained in the .txt file beginning with “MOSAIC_res”.  The scenarios they apply to are given in the remainder of the file name.
